# About JAdventure
In the deepest depths of the harshest corner of the world lies the Blasted Land, a place where few men have crossed and even fewer have lingered there long. By it is the great fortress of Bak'al-Thur, a fortress that has weathered attacks from the corrupted land for eons beyond eons. It is said that howls of agony drift from the land of death every night and guttural noises that could only belong to the most vicious of beasts. It is said that the Blasted Lands was hell dragged up to the surface, and would have devoured the world had a great mage not thrown the heavens down to meet it.

Of course, "it is said" does not equal "it is," and humans are fond of making rumours out of thin air. Yet one catches your attention, one that speaks of great wealth and treasure. A great cave full of treasure, guarded by a winged serpent or perhaps even a dragon. Treasure beyond a man's dreams, treasure more than any king could hope for. And so, you saddled your little pony and rode out into the depthless night.
